# Machine-learning-approaches-for-air-quality-prediction
Addressing the challenge of air quality assessment in India, this research leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques.The study focuses on two key datasets: one capturing air quality before the implementation of a policy and another after its implementation. The Bharat stage 6 (BS6) policy was taken. The datasets are available in kaggle.

It involves the implementation of several ML models, like Decision Trees (DT), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT). Additionally, it also explores deep learning techniques, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and hybrid models like Convolutional Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Unit (CNN-GRU), Convolutional Neural Network with Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM). These DL models are employed to further evaluate the performance of the ML models in predicting air quality.

Through this comprehensive evaluation, the project aims to gain insights into the effectiveness of various ML and DL models in predicting air pollution levels, thereby contributing to a better understanding of air quality assessment in India. 

This concludes that the best model depends on the dataset also as I got different performance results of models for different datasets.
